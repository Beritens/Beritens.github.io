This game was made for a game jam. A musician (named Anakken) and I created this game in a week.


And this is the first game I created with the (Bevy Game Engine)[https://bevy.org/]
The fun of this game comes from the sheer number of enemies that spawn, and this is exactly where Bevy’s entity-component-system (ECS) really shines.

Even with such a short timeframe, the game is surprisingly complex and enjoyable. Using an ECS, we can create a few components like "Walking", "Attacking", or "Attackable", and then write systems to handle their behavior. From there, it’s easy to experiment. Combining components in different ways quickly leads to a lot of variety and interesting mechanics.

This architecture made it effortless to explore possibilities, resulting in a very playful and satisfying development cycle. 10/10 would recommend.

I’m also very proud of the art. Paired with the music, it creates a cohesive and appealing atmosphere that received a lot of praise.
