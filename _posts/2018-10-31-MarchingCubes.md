This might be the project that made me fall in love with Computer Graphics.
At this point I was still in school and somewhere online I stumbled upon the the Marching-Cubes Algorithm.
Being able to generate worlds with just some math was fascinating for me.

This also made me think a lot about performance. Generating terrains on the fly is quite expensive (at least the way I did it back then). To still accomplish acceptable framerates I had to learn abot multithreading. Fun times.
