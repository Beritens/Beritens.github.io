Don't you think websites have become a bit boring? \
Don't you rather want to play a game instead of actually reading? \
Probably not, but here's an extension that does it anyway.

<br>

This is just a test page to play around with the mechanics without \
the need of downloading the extension. \
And it is still early in development...\
A lot will change, but I will keep the old version running on this page\
to actually experience what change. Basically a very interactive devlog.\
The extension allows you to jump and swing around on any webpage.

<br>

So... let's begin. Press the button to start the game: <button onclick="addScript()">Click me</button>

As you can see, a character appeared at the top of the page. Try to  jump down -> here <- \
The controls are very much inspired by the "game getting over it."


<br>

<br>

Try  to get familiar with the controls. Here's a challenge: jump &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  over this gap. You can do this!

<br>

<br>

<br>



But there's more. You can also swing around (hence the name). Left click to shoot a rope.\
You can hook on text and swing around by moving your mouse.\
You can even move the mouse down to pull yourself up.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

Now you can cross even bigger gaps&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; This should be easy.


<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

That's it. A simple concept but imagine all the possibilities. \
Youtube comments filled with levels. \
A dedicated subreddit where where levels can be rated. \
Just swinging around on random pages when you are bored. \
So there's basically already a level editor and a rating system! \
And I don't have to do any networking stuff!


Of course, just swinging around everywhere is kinda overpowered. \
To introduce some difficulty, you are not allowed to hook special characters:

That's it for now. This is a small introduction to the game.
There are many interesting challenges to making this work in the browser, and everything builds on a custom physics engine, so there are definitely more topics worth writing about. Stay tuned! (maybe)
