This is just a test page. \
I'm currently working on an &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; extension that allows you to jump around a webpage. \
The extension isn't available &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; yet but I made this page so you can already test it out.

<br>

So... let's begin. Press the    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;           button to start the game: <button onclick="addScript()">Click me</button>


<br>

<br>

As you can see. 
The controls are very much inspired by getting over it. Try jumping over   &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;   this gap. 

<br>

<br>

<br>



But that's not it... &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;    <- You can also swing around. \
Try to swing to the left.



<br>

<br>




That's basically it. A simple concept but imagine all the possiblities. \
Youtube comments filled with levels. \
Rated levels in a dedicated subreddit. \
Just swinging around on random pages when you are bored. \
Custom pages with challenging getting-over-it-esque maps. 


Of course, just swinging around everywhere is kinda overpowered. \
To introduce some difficulty, you are not allowed to hook special characters:
