This game was made for the ludum dare game jame together with my brother.
We only had 3 days to finish the game. It was stressful but a lot of fun.

We actually scored quite well (got 6th place in the fun category)
The game is quite simple, you draw a line and a ball rolls over it... get as far a possible.

This was also my first experience collaborating with someone on a coding project. It introduced me to working together using Git and Kanban boards. Today, I use these skills almost daily at work. They’ve become second nature to me. I owe it all to you, Doodle Ball.
