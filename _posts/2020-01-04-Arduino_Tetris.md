This was a small project for the open house day at my school.
I programmed the classic game Tetris on an Arduino.
It was a great change of pace to also work with the hardware, such as wiring the screen and the input.
Working close to the hardware was a lot of fun, and it was delightful to see the nostalgia on the faces of parents and teachers who tried it.


Also, this was my first experience working with C++: (https://github.com/Beritens/Arduino_Tetris)[https://github.com/Beritens/Arduino_Tetris]
