This was the first game I ever published on the Google Play Store.

At the time, I was still quite new to Unity—but ambitious. The game itself is nothing special: a simple platformer with some fun buoyancy mechanics. But I had a bold idea: adding a level editor.
The funny part? I had no idea how to actually implement any of it. I ended up reinventing at least three wheels along the way.

I didn’t know how to serialize and save game data (these days I’d probably just use JSON), so I created my own file format and manually encoded all the level data.

I didn’t know what a database was, so I saved everything on a web server and searched through the file system with a messy PHP script.

I didn’t know how authentication works, so I built my own system that stores user data in plain text on the backend. I still cringe thinking about it!

But somehow, it all worked. I started this project because I loved games, and it ended up teaching me something even more valuable: it’s the problem-solving and creativity required in game development that truly fascinates me.
