A fun physics based puzzle game

I worked on this project in the time between school and university. Previous games I made used a lot of physics but it always bothered me that Unity's physics weren't deterministic.

That means that with the same initial condidtions the simulation could sometimes play out differently.
I then stumbled onto a hack that allows for determinism in Unity and I used this knowledge to make a game.

The concept is quite simple. A ball is thrown very badly, there is no change it will go in the basket. You then have to place balck holes to change the trajactory and make it score.
This starts simple but gets very tricky in the end.

I went all out with the art. I had a lot of fun designing the characters the environment. I even came up with a fun story featuring a scientist who just wants to use his invention to help his son play some BBall.


I published this on the Google Play Store and got few downloads and nice comments, sadly a few year later it got removed due to some policy issues.
